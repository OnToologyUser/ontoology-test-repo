# Abstract
The Core Person Vocabulary is a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of a Person. 

# 1. Introduction
The Core Person Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a natural person, i.e. the individual as opposed to any role they may play in society or the relationships they have to other people, organisations and property; all of which contribute significantly to the broader concept of identity.
